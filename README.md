This file explains the steps I have taken in constructing the run_analysis.R srcipt for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

This script is intended to do five things:


1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

This is done with a simple 

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
  with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
